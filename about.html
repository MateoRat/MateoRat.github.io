            <div class="mainText"> We cannot stress enough: SLASHJAY CONTAINS DISTURBING AND SENSITIVE MATERIAL. While some potentially triggering scenes can be skipped, Slashjay has triggering content that is unavoidable. <br>
                <br>
                Some unavoidable triggers are: <br>
                - Depictions of trauma and mental disorders, <br>
                - panic attacks/flashbacks (often related to PTSD), <br>
                - death (including child and animal death), <br>
                - murder, <br>
                - suicidal thoughts and ideation/tendencies, <br>
                - mentioned suicide attempts, <br>
                - childhood abuse and trauma, <br>
                - occasional mild gore (and rarely more graphic gore), <br>
                - mentions of alcohol and drug use, <br>
                - and slight adult material (swearing, innuendos, brief sexual comments or implications,). <br>
                <br>
              Slashjay is <b>not intended for children</b> and is intended for an adult and teen audience. Themes of trauma, depression, survivor's guilt, <b>serious mental health issues</b>, and violence are all heavy in the comic and are, at times, centeral plot points. If you are in a dark place or are triggered by this content, <b>DO NOT READ THE FUCKING COMIC</b>.<br>
              <br>
              In other words, <a class="mainLink" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUKmq7UMJys'><b>Dead Dove: Do Not Eat</b></a>

    <div class="funkyfresh">Boundaries</div>
    <div class="gay">
        <div class="mainText"><b>> General Boundaries</b><ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li>- Fanart, edits, and fanwork in general is awesome!!! Please make it and tag/send it to us!</li><br>
            <li>- NSFW of our ADULT character designs are alrightâ€” please just don't tag us/send it to us as many team members are still minors!</li>
            <li>> For the love of God, though, <i>please don't sexualize children</i>, make NSFW artwork of them, etc. Just... gross.</li><br>
            <li>- Ships are cool and we don't mind them! Even if we personally aren't fans and it's not canon in the comic, shipping is totally fine. Just <i>pleaseeee</i> no incest, pedophilia, etc, don't glamorize abusive relationships, and please don't ignore canon character sexualities/genders. Happy shipping!</li><br>
            <li>- This comic is not for enjoyers of guro/graphic NSFW/L artwork who are seeking that content and engagement makes us deeply uncomfortable.</li><br>
            <li>- Redesigns are cool! But please don't change <i>major</i> character aspects. And please, we beg you not to change (canon) skin colors, races, and ethnicities. </li><br>
            <li>- Headcanons are chill (oh, you headcanon Gregory as hispanic? Fuckin cool love that!), just not removing traits we've specifically chosen to give characters. For example, Charlie and her mom are Indigenous, Vanessa is a lesbian, and Cassidy is Asian! Please don't remove those traits. </li><br>
            <li>- Anti-recovery behavior makes us uncomfortable and we do not support it.</li><br>
            <li>- As stated... many times, We do NOT support Scott Cawthon. Scott made our and many others' childhoods, and we respect him for that. That being said, Scott has said things, done things, and supported politicians that deeply hurt us and many other members of the fandom. If you support or defend Scott, you are not welcome here.</li><br>
            <li>- And, last but not least, don't harass people for breaking our boundaries! Please just kindly inform them, and if they refuse to follow those boundaries, just don't interact.</li>
