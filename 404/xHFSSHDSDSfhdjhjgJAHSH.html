    <div class="text">Really now?<br><br>
    This is a page not linked on <i>any</i> other page on the site, nor on the socials, nor <i>anywhere else</i>. The URL is impossible to guess—if you say it isn't, I don't believe you. <br><br>
Let's be honest here, yeah? <i>You didn't find this page on your own.</i><br><br>
If you read the file "READthis.txt", which you probabably did, <i>considering you're poking around the files</i>, we make it clear how much <i>love</i> we pour into this comic and this site, explain how we don't want people to look through the site's files to find secrets/secret pages, and state that all easter eggs can be found on the site, without looking through code. The closest thing you will find to an easter egg is this message.<br><br>
It's disappointing spending <i>hours</i> trying to make this site and make fun easter eggs that people are able to find. Have you ever spent a long ass time on a surprise for somebody, just to have it spoiled? It sucks, doesn't it? Putting all that thought and effort into a gift—getting so excited to see the reactions.<br><br>
It isn't just the easter eggs, it's the hunt to find them. We want it to be <i>fun</i>, a reward. A love letter to those who take the time and energy to explore the site and get curious.<br><br>
<i>There aren't any easter eggs here.</i> Stop looking. </div>
