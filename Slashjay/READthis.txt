Oh!
 Hello there!
     I see you've stumbled into the site files on the GitHub repository...
          ~:—  .-. . .- -..  —:~

       Here's the thing about that...

 We have no problem with people exploring the files to see how the site works, use it as inspiration, or look at some of our asset files.

With that said... Time and effort has been put into the creation of this site, and GitHub Pages happened to be the easiest place to host it. Because of that, it's easy to view files and source code. The site has various easter eggs and secret pages. So, naturally, it would be far easier to find them by just going through the repository or picking apart code.

But... that wasn't how we wanted you to find things.

These secrets are meant to be found and enjoyed, but searching through the files to uncover them takes away the fun of a search, it's not how it was intended to be found. We've put love into creating rewards for people who take the time to explore the site and comic and appreciate the little details. There are no easter eggs in the code, I promise you that. (/srs.)

I guess what I'm trying to say is... enjoy the site how it was meant to be enjoyed, search for secret pages on your own. Talk about it, share it! But enjoy the hunt.


     TL;DR, there are easter eggs and secrets/secret pages that can be discovered through the files, but that isn't how they're meant to be found, so please don't use the public repository to discover them.

Thank you for reading! And thank you for joining us :]
