    I initially was not planning on making a public statement regarding Emily's recent response video. However, in light of recent replies I've gotten and comments I have seen, I've made the choice to come forward a final time. I want to clarify what happened, speak my truth, and overall address what has been said. What I am not here to do is fuel drama, or to promote a “cancellation” of Emily.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Preface</div>
    I want to clarify: I DO NOT THINK THAT EMILY IS A PEDOPHILE, OR NECESSARILY A GROOMER. Her behavior was disgusting, inappropriate, and sickening, but I will not claim her to be either of those things, especially a pedophile. From what my friends and I went through, I do believe that Emily engaged in sexual harassment and HSB. However, I am not someone involved in the justice system, I am not a court of law, I am not an investigator — I was someone who was hurt. Anyone reading this is free to their own judgement, and I post this with the expectation that people will draw their own, rational conclusions from it.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">What happened</div>
    In July 2022, Emily and I met during the first episode of a close friend of mine's new Minecraft SMP. We made an alliance early on, and quickly began flirting with one another — soon after, leading to us to begin dating.<br>
    <br>
    Three days after we began dating, she began asking me questions related to sex/sexual preferences, I answered, but tried to disengage and said I wasn't comfortable or ready doing anything. The conversation shifted, and she brought it up again. Without going into detail, this behavior continued until I eventually said I was, once again, uncomfortable with those things, and had some trauma from being groomed before. She did quickly apologize, and then stopped asking. After that, we only had a few more conversations.<br>
    <br>
    One of our mutual friends asked me how Emily and I were doing. I answered honestly, which is when I learned Emily had been doing weird things with them and another mutual friend, who were fourteen and fifteen respectively. I don't want to go into too many details, to save both my time and my sanity. You can find more information in my old thread, as well as the thread that one of those friends posted. All of this behavior went on before and during our short time dating.<br>
    <br>
    To cut to the chase, we confronted Emily privately, everything was handled, and we cut contact with her. Eventually, she reached out to my two friends a few months later with another apology. Once again, this was handled privately.<br>
    <br>
    Cutting forward a year later (August 2023) was when we learned Emily would be joining MCC Rising. As much as we wanted things to rest, we knew that could massively boost her audience of mostly children and pre-teens. We made the choice to reach out to Emily's team with everything that happened — through that, we did also learn that Emily was close with several minors around that same age range and was still making odd comments, although it was not as bad as before. We gathered all of our evidence and accounts and approached Noxcrew. Everything was handled internally. That's also when Emily deleted all of her content and dropped off the internet.<br>
    <br>
    We initially were not planning on coming forward publicly, but chose to do so when rumors were circulating around Team Axolotl dropping out and Emily's sudden disappearance.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Today (A conclusion)</div>
    As I've mentioned, this is a clarification because of the fact I've received some hate, and I've also noticed many people are unaware of what happened. I am, frankly, disappointed in Emily's response. I do not blame her for debunking misinformation and false allegations, although I feel that she did not take full accountability for her actions, which is part of the reason I am making this post. After she posted her video, I messaged Emily privately, and we have spoken about the situation. She has told me that she regrets her actions and is aware of how terrible they were, and is now trying to get better and is in therapy.<br>
    <br>
    I am still angry, hurt, disappointed, disgusted, all the words. I do not like Emily, I am not friends with her, and I do not forgive her. To me, she feels like a monster. That said, I want to be as respectful as possible in this situation. I am not Emily, I am not all-knowing, I am not a therapist, I am not a court, and I cannot fairly determine her true intentions. My hope is that her words and apologies are genuine, and that she betters herself as a person as she claims to be doing. While I do not forgive her, I do not want her to receive harassment. Despite the hurt she has caused, she is a human being, and I wish to see her succeed and become more than that monster that I see her as.<br>
    <br>
    Once this post is made, how people choose to interpret it and view Emily after this are up to them. Whether you decide to support her is up to you, and you are free to make that choice. All that I ask is that you do so with respect, nuance, and thought.<br>
    <br>
    Thank you.

    <div class="subHeader">More on Emily's response (to me)</div>
    Prior to posting this, I messaged Emily again letting her know that I was planning on posting something. I did not want to blindsight her, and also requested that she support me publicly, which she agreed to. Regardless of how upset I still am, I do appreciate her willingness to support me.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Why I'm not going into detail or providing screenshots</div>
    This entire situation was disgusting and deeply personal. Aside from the fact those screenshots are difficult to look at, they hold a lot of information I (and others involved) do not want posted publicly, especially because we were children at the time. The needed information was provided publicly, and the people who need evidence most have that evidence. If you want more information, contact me and I am willing to discuss things. Additionally, all of this happened before Emily came out as trans. Because of that, a lot of it contains her deadname/misgenders her. While this is not my main reason, it is an additional one.<br>
    <br>
    TL;DR, it's quite personal, I want this to rest, I don't want to look at it again, and I feel it's better off this way.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">A brief correction and apology</div>
    In my original post, I said Emily was eighteen when we were dating—that was a miscalculation. When we started dating, Emily was seventeen, about three and a half weeks from eighteen, and I was sixteen, a little over five months away from seventeen. If it was unclear in my original post, my problem with Emily was not about the age gap between us, but rather in how she treated me, and what she did to my friends.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Feelings, facts, and rationality</div>
    I strive to be as reasonable and level-headed as possible. I try to avoid strong, biased language, and keep to the facts. That said, this entire situation is incredibly emotionally charged. At a certain point, I am going to speak from the heart, and that's what my ending was. I ask that people keep that in mind.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Being trans</div>
    while Emily is transgender, that should not be part of this conversation. Trans people can do bad things, and that is not a reflection upon the trans community as a whole. Please, do not demonize her for being trans, and do not defend her because she is trans.<br>

    <div class="subHeader">Why am I not posting all of this to Twitter</div>
    Twitter sucks.
