            <div class="mainText">
                Our story begins in the early to mid '70s with two ambitious, creative men, and their small families.<br><br>
                
                The Aftons were a family of three living in London, England—their life was a challenging one, balancing raising a son at a young and unprepared age while also having busy careers and ambitious goals. Meanwhile, the Emilys were raising their twins in Hurricane, Utah. After crossing paths one day, Henry Emily and William Afton quickly bonded over their shared career, dreams for something bigger, and being parents to children around the same age. Determined and reluctantly supported by their wives, they pushed through the busy schedules, distance, and financial limits, working to make their dreams a reality.

        <div class="headerOne">Fredbear's Family Diner and the Beginning of Fazbear Ent.</div>
            <div class="mainText">
                Fredbear's Family Diner opened in the mid 70s, located in Hurricane and starring Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. The restaurant was humble, small, and a risk, but it worked out. Growing in popularity, William and Henry finally began seeing success. The Puppet was introduced, the Aftons officially moved to Hurricane, and Henry and William set their sights on expanding.<br><br>
                
                William and Henry worked on plans for a TV series and a new, larger restaurant arcade, one with more advanced animatronics, more attractions, and more opportunities. Entering a new decade, the show was green lit and picked up by a studio and began production. Development on the four new animatronics began, hype was building around the upcoming show and restaurant, and expectations were high.<br><br>
                
                Though not previously mentioned, Henry and William had two 'helpers'. Throughout their short lives, Charlie and Michael shared a fascination with the animatronics. They were always hanging around in some way, and always around one another, having quickly become best friends.<br><br>
                
                But all good things, one day, come to an end.<br><br>
                
                Locked behind the restaurant in the pouring rain after going through a wrong door, none of the kids seemed to notice Charlie's cries. With the Puppet, an animatronic made to protect her and her twin brother, stuck in its box, she was effectively trapped outside. Seeing headlights and the familiar purple car William, her 'uncle', drove, she thought herself to be saved. As he exited the car, calling out her name in concern, she ran over. And then he froze. Vacantly staring at a confused and soaking wet Charlie.<br><br>
                
                On March 3rd, 1983, Charlotte Ajei Emily was strangled to death and dragged to a back alley. While a frenzied Henry searched for his missing daughter, accompanied by an oddly quiet William, the Puppet escaped its box. Finding its designated child and attempting to 'save' her, Puppet, an emotionless, personalityless, security animatronic, felt love.<br><br>
                
                Charlie was never able to watch Fazbear and Friends, having aired its first episode a month later.

            <div class="mainText">
                Despite the tragedy that took place, Fredbear's recovered. The show aired. William and Henry's company was officially named Fazbear Entertainment. And Freddy Fazbear's Pizza officially opened.<br><br>
                
                Henry was never the same, always haunted by a lingering grief. William changed, continuing to grow distant, aggressive, his relationship with Michael going from being close and near inseparable, to aloof, cold, and eventually abusive.<br><br>
                
                William began work on his own restaurant, Circus Baby's Pizza World, one with dark intentions. Opening day, his daughter wanted nothing more than to see the star animatronic, Circus Baby. Repeatedly denied, Elizabeth took matters into her own hands, sneaking away to see Circus Baby.<br><br>
                
                On March 28th, 1976, Elizabeth Afton was lured and killed by her own father's creation. As the restaurant shut down the very day it opened and the animatronics went into storage, Circus Baby still couldn't stop hearing the voice of the little girl she offered ice cream to.<br><br>
                
                She never did get to spend Christmas with her siblings that year.

            <div class="mainText">
                Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and Fazbear and Friends still did well, only continuing to grow in popularity. Meanwhile, William only grew worse. Evelyn, his wife, struggled to look him in the eye, and eventually, even her own sons', becoming mostly absent. Michael, fueled by grief and an inability to cope, continued his spiral of teenage delinquency. Evan, the littlest of the Afton children, grew more distressed—plagued by 'nightmares' every night that kept him awake and fighting, as well as being constantly tormented by his brother.<br><br>
                
                With Evan forced to have his birthday party be at Fredbear's, a place he had grown to fear, Michael and his friends planned a prank. After some teasing and name-calling, they dragged him toward the stage, where Michael had the great idea of having him give Fredbear a 'kiss'. Michael and his friend Cris, dawning a Bonnie mask, lifted Evan into Fredbear's mouth. As Evan's thrashed in Fredbear's mouth and his tears continued to wet the internal mechanisms, Fredbear's sensitive springlocks snapped back into their original position.<br><br>
                
                On June 13th, 1987, Evan Afton's head was crushed by Fredbear after a prank gone wrong. While Henry and William made the decision not to re-open, Evelyn decided she was done with her marriage, and Michael was practically unresponsive, Evan was comatose in the hospital. He died several weeks later.<br><br>
                
                Michael and his friends would never stop seeing the blood.<br><br>
            </div>
        <div class="headerOne">Success and Failure</div>
            <div class="mainText">
                The Afton family had gone from a loving, however slightly nonconventional, family, to being a father and son who rarely spoke outside of fighting and drunken yelling.<br><br>
                
                Henry tried to stay hopeful. But William showed little of the man he once was.<br><br>
                
                Fazbear Entertainment still flourished. With the bite incident reduced to mostly rumors and the occasional whisper, the show and restaurant hit its peak popularity. As the summer of '89 hit, the restaurant was swarming with kids and summer birthdays.<br><br>
                
                Freshly thirteen-year-old Gabriel Barrett planned a quiet birthday celebration with his friends Cassidy Williams and Jeremy Walker. Suddenly sprung with the task of watching his brother, Jeremy's five-year-old brother, Fritz, tagged along. Meanwhile, ten-year-old Susie Crespo was upset over the sudden death of her dog the previous day. Her mother, busy with a very important meeting with the AC repair guy who she (for some reason) frequently met with, dropped her off at Freddy's to cheer her up and distract her for a few hours. As Jeremy, Fritz, and Gabriel arrived to Freddy's, Cassidy was running late—still at home in a heated argument with her older brother.<br><br>
                
                And as kids went in and out and employees had no time for slacking, William put his plan into motion. Dawning his Spring Bonnie suit, he approached Gabriel first. Interested in the idea of seeing the animatronics backstage, he blindly followed 'Spring Bonnie' to the backroom. Next was little Susie, playing an arcade game through tear-filled eyes. Swayed by the promise of seeing her dog, Sparky, she followed. Soon, Jeremy realized that Fritz was gone—quickly convinced by William to follow him so he could see Foxy. Finally, being told that his little brother and friend were backstage, Jeremy cautiously followed William to the backroom.<br><br>
                
                Cassidy arrived late. Receiving confirmation that her friends had arrived, she searched. And searched. And searched. And an "employees only" sign was not going to be enough to stop her from finding them. And while she *did* uncover the location of her friends, she also uncovered the man who was in the process of relocating their bodies to the animatronics.<br><br>
                
                On June 26th, 1989, Gabriel Barrett died after being struck in the back of the head with a hand crank, Susie Crespo, Jeremy and Fritz Walker, and Cassidy Williams were all killed after being stabbed. The five were reported missing, and despite extensive search efforts and even discovering reminents of blood, they were never found. The search dogs kept barking at the animatronics. The animatronics stared back.<br><br>
                
                They never got their birthday cake.

I don't like picking a specific year for this game because I feel like it limits things. The only reason Slashjay ""officially"" takes place in 2018 is because it was hard writing without stating the year. Think of Slashjay as taking place in its own little bubble of time... it's technically 2018, but it can mention events from 2020 because it has its own little pocket of time and space. Just don't think too hard about it. </div>--> </div></div>
