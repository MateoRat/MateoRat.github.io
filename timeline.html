            <!-- <div class="mainIndent"> > Security Breach (and Slashjay, by extention) take place 2018 or after. I don't like picking a specific year for this game because I feel like it limits things. The only reason Slashjay ""officially"" takes place in 2018 is because it was hard writing without stating the year. Think of Slashjay as taking place in its own little bubble of time... it's technically 2018, but it can mention events from 2020 because it has its own little pocket of time and space. Just don't think too hard about it. </div>--> </div></div>
